1. Woah dude. Upon opening this application. You are floating. Through space. On a grid. Whaaat. 
2. But just you wait. Because you can CONTROL yourself. You have the power to MOVE. 
3. But how? How can I move in this cruel plane? WELL I'M HERE TO TELL YOU. 

4.  YOu will start in first person mode: HERE ARE YOUR CONTROLS:
          __      __             NOTE(clark): YOu can also click and drag to move the camera around :)
         /  \    /  \

 /_____/  \        /  /_____/   
           \__/\  /             
                \/              
   _____    _________________

5. These keys will move you around how you would expect them to. Forward. Backwards. Left and Right. 

6. You may be asking at this point: "WHY THE HECK IS THIS SO BORING? I'VE PLAYED FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS BEFORE"
7. BAM WHAM. Then I hit you with MULTIPLE CONTROL SCHEMES!!
8. Press 'C' or 'SPACE' to swap to MAYA MODE! Where you can click around the screen with middle, right, and 
	left clicks to pretend like you're modeling something. 
9. Just so you know. You can't model things. That would be WAY too cool for this program. 

NOTE(clark): I copied that cool little axis camera at the bottom left. I liked it.
